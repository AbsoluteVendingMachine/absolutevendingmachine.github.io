    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">After a month of intermittent development, my new website (which is currently being hosting through GitHub Pages) is finally finished.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">I made this website for several reasons, such as performance, simplicity, and colloquialism.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">So no matter what I do, there will always be a central for my work, as well as useful information such as contacts.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">I hope you enjoy the new site, and if you have any issues, please report them here:</p>
