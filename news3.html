    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">-Well, I wish updates were more frequent.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">I changed the website background to be darker for accessibility.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">As for my work, it ended up being very busy this year. But I did make a lot of stuff.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">And now, I'll be spending a lot of time on personal projects that I haven't been able to work on.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">A new video is in the works, and I can also now say that Pumpice is 80% complete.</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">Hopefully I'll have some stuff out soon and I can get back to work on CS:TD!</p>
    <p style="font-family:defaultFont">I have some new ideas for development strategies to suggest a 2026 completion time.</p>
