	<p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">2025 January Update<br>1/19/25</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">Apologies for the delay in updating my catalogues on this site. Updates will be more frequent.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">Although it has taken much longer than I wanted, I am back to working on Pumpice now.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">There will be major direction changes and I may skip a demo release outright.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">I would like to also state that because of Pumpice, I have put CS:TD on hold.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">But I plan to complete it as well as work on more videos in the future.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Fira Sans Condensed">I hope 2025 will be a more eventful year!</p>
